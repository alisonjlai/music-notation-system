# Gesture-based Music Notation System

Welcome to the Gesture-based Music Notation System, a user-friendly interface that enables users to input musical notation through gesture recognition.

## Introduction

This innovative system utilizes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to interpret gestures into musical notation, making the process of composing music intuitive and interactive.

## Setup

To get started with this system, please follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure Java is installed on your machine.

### Installation and Setup

1. Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/alisonjlai/music-notation-system.git

2. Change into the project directory:

cd MusicNotation

### Usage

To use the system, perform the following steps:

1. Train the gesture recognition model by executing `shapeTrainer.java`.
   Some shapes worthy of training: S-S W-W E-E SW-SW N-N W-S E-S

2. Once training is complete, you can start the music notation editor by running `AppMusicEd.java`

Enjoy creating music with gestures!

[The project is in the stage of awaiting further updates.]
