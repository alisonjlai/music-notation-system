# Gesture-based Music Notation System

Welcome to the Gesture-based Music Notation System, a user-friendly interface that enables users to input musical notation through gesture recognition.

## Introduction

This innovative system utilizes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to interpret gestures into musical notation, making the process of composing music intuitive and interactive.

## Features

- **Gesture-Based Input**: Slide to initiate staff lines for notation. Additional gestures allow for adding and adjusting musical elements.
- **Note Creation**: Quick swipes are used to add notes with stems, representing different pitches and lengths.
- **Interactive Editing**: The system allows for immediate editing, such as adding or removing notes and other musical symbols.
- **Visual Indicators**: Responsive visual feedback is provided for each action to ensure accuracy in music creation.

## Setup

To get started with this system, please follow the instructions below.

### Installation and Setup

1. Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/alisonjlai/music-notation-system.git`

2. Change into the project directory: `cd MusicNotation`

### Usage

To use the system, perform the following steps:

1. Train the gesture recognition model by executing `shapeTrainer.java`.

- Some shapes worthy of training: S-S W-W E-E SW-SW N-N W-S E-S

2. Once training is complete, you can start the music notation editor by running `AppMusicEd.java`

#### Enjoy creating music with gestures!
